# Ferris 3 [![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/jonparrott/ferris3/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/jonparrott/ferris3/latest)

**Ferris 3** is a collection of flexible utilities for Google App Engine Python.

**Ferris 3** makes using App Engine services easier regardless of which web framework you're using. It provides tools for ndb, memcache, search, oauth2, google APIs, and more.

If you plan on using [Google Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/), Ferris provides excellent standalone tooling around Cloud Endpoints that can make defining and managing your services much easier.

Examples
--------

There are lots of tools for caching, such as the ``@cache`` decorator:

```python
@ferris3.caching.cache('guestbook-posts', ttl=30)
def get_greetings():
    return GuestbookPost.query().order(-GuestbookPost.created).fetch(20)

@app.route('/')
def guestbook_list():
    greetings = get_greetings()
    return render_template("guestbook.html", greetings=greetings)
```

Using Cloud Endpoints has never been easier:

```python
from protorpc import messages
from ferris3 import auto_service, auto_method, Service


class BasicMessage(messages.Message):
    content = messages.StringField(1)


@auto_service
class BasicService(Service):

    @auto_method(returns=BasicMessage)
    def get(self, request, name=(str,)):
        return BasicMessage(content="Hello, %s!" % name)

```
